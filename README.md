# DeHeritage
DeHeritage is designed to serve as a means of retrieval of assets from lost accounts. It allows you to transfer your assets to your heir in a decentralized manner. Users will be able to secure their fortune as an inheritance to next of kin(s) or retrieve lost funds from misplaced wallet and more.
##	How I built it
It was built using, React, EthersJs and solidity. I also used Chainlink Automation to handle automatic execution of the transactions.
##	Challenges I ran into
I found some difficulties in Creating an Automation compactible contract and Handling edge cases in smart contract due to lack of experience. Some techniques I used went wrong too. Managing time was also a great challenge for me.
